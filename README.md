0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

===========================================
This project is a collaboration between 2 ALX software engineering students. Eric Wambugu and Joshua Onsomu.

=========================================================
The objectives of this project are to learn, understand and explain:
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm

======================================================================================
The following are the general requirements required to accomplish the project's objectives
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
9. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
10. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
11. Don’t forget to push your header file
12. All your header files should be include guarded
13. A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

Project tasks
0. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence

Prototype: void shell_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must use the following sequence of intervals (a.k.a the Knuth sequence):
n+1 = n * 3 + 1
1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...
You’re expected to print the array each time you decrease the interval (See example below).
No big O notations of the time complexity of the Shell sort (Knuth sequence) algorithm needed - as the complexity is dependent on the size of array and gap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm

Prototype: void cocktail_sort_list(listint_t **list);
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 101-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm

Prototype: void counting_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You can assume that array will contain only numbers >= 0
You are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
You’re expected to print your counting array once it is set up (See example below)
This array is of size k + 1 where k is the largest number in array
Write in the file 102-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Counting sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
