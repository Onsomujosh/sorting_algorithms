0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

===========================================
This project is a collaboration between 2 ALX software engineering students. Eric Wambugu and Joshua Onsomu.

=========================================================
The objectives of this project are to learn, understand and explain:
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
